Non-nil if Company-Statistics mode is enabled.
See the `company-statistics-mode' command
for a description of this minor mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `company-statistics-mode'.")

Statistical sorting for company-mode.  Ranks completion candidates by
the frequency with which they have been chosen in recent (as given by
`company-statistics-size') history.

If called interactively, enable Company-Statistics mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it if ARG is zero or negative.  If called
from Lisp, also enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil, and
toggle it if ARG is `toggle'; disable the mode otherwise.

Turning this mode on and off preserves the statistics.  They are also
preserved automatically between Emacs sessions in the default
configuration.  You can customize this behavior with
`company-statistics-auto-save', `company-statistics-auto-restore' and
`company-statistics-file'.
