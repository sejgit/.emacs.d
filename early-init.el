;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Emacs HEAD (27+) introduces early-init.el, which is run before init.el,
;; before package and UI initialization happens.
;;

;;; Code:

;;;;; Package-enable prevent early 
;; Package initialize occurs automatically, before `user-init-file' is
;; loaded, but after `early-init-file'. We handle package
;; initialization, so we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!
;; (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
